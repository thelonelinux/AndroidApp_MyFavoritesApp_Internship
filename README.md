MVP(MINIMAL VIABLE PRODUCT)
In this app we have various types of tools like cameras, videos , paints , notepads,
docs editor , text editor in this single app. Rather than switching to various other apps
for each different action we have brought here all the tools in one place .
User now not anymore have to bother downloading different apps for each tool
separately.

OVERVIEW
Our project involved us to get familiar with the Android Development environment and
thus develop an application to serve as a personal companion to user.
We basically focus on adding as much as possible tools in our app that we require in
our day to day life .
We have also implemented the way we view our contents in each category. For that we
have added checkbox . If user has finished with that particular content then he can mark
it as completed. Else leave it unchecked.
So for this case we have implemented the view options (like filter).
If he clicks on the COMPLETED tab, the list of all those completed (Checked) items will
appear.
If he clicks on the REMAINING tab, the list of all those incompleted (Unchecked) items
will appear.
We also implemented swipeable tabs so as to provide ease in navigating between
Completed (Checked) items and Remaining (Unchecked) items.
That the functionality part,now for the part, we focussed our efforts to build an intuitive,
clean and simple UI. For the same, we encompassed card UI in our app. These
beautiful cards,originally inspired from google now, makes the saved notes look
aesthetically pleasing.OUR APPROACH
 We approached this project to learn about the android development environment
to build something.
With this in mind, first we developed a lot of apps which implements different
aspects of android ability and which were totally unrelated to our project.
Among those were a Tablayout, Tools for each options, Splash screen, music
player,video player, text viewer and others Now, after getting pretty much
exposure in android development, we decided to go ahead with our project app.
Ignoring the futile attempts to add many features in our app,which unfortunately
could not be made possible, the work of our final app can be divided into the
following phases:
 Swipable Tabs
 Floating action button for each tool to add new
 RecyclerView to store content
 Card UI
 Add Music Player and Video Player
